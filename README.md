# 🛡️ Smart Infant Safety and Monitoring System
*A Life-Saving Innovation in Emergency Response & Infant Care 👶⚠️*

## 📘 Overview

Inspired by real-life earthquake emergencies in countries like Japan and China, this Semester 4 group project introduces an automated, sensor-integrated infant safety system. Our goal: to enhance real-time emergency response and provide continuous environmental and health monitoring for infants, particularly in disaster-prone areas.

In situations where caregivers may struggle to respond quickly, this system offers a vital technological solution by combining intelligent sensing, environmental control, and protective automation.

## 🌟 Key Functionalities

### 🔸 Earthquake Detection & Protective Response
- A custom-built vibration sensor simulates seismic activity.
- Two DC motors automatically activate a **protective shield** around the cot.
- This gives caregivers **critical reaction time** during emergencies.

### 🔸 Smart Baby Monitoring
- **Environmental Monitoring**:  
  - **LM35** and **AMT1001** sensors monitor **temperature** and **humidity**.
  - A **DC fan** automatically regulates the environment.
- **Cry Detection**:  
  - A **sound sensor** detects infant cries.
  - A **servo motor** rocks the cot to comfort the baby automatically.

### 🔸 Real-Time Control & Visualization with LabVIEW
- All signals are processed via an **NI DAQ** card.
- A custom **LabVIEW GUI** displays:
  - Live sensor data
  - Manual/Auto control toggles
  - System status indicators and performance metrics

### 🔸 System Architecture
- **Arduino Uno** is used **only** to control the servo motor.
- All other sensor inputs and actuator outputs are handled through the **NI DAQ platform**, ensuring high-speed analog interfacing and accuracy.
